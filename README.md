# SSN Secure Share

A file sharing app we built for our Networks Lab at SSN College of Engineering. Basically it lets people on the same LAN share files without needing internet or any cloud stuff.

## What it does

- Share files with other users on your network
- Multi-share: send to multiple people at once
- Drag and drop upload
- See who sent you what (inbox)
- Delete files you don't need anymore
- Shows your network info and connected devices

## How to run

1. Install the requirements:
```
pip install flask psutil
```

2. Run the app:
```
python app.py
```

3. Open in browser - it shows both localhost and your LAN IP so others can access it
